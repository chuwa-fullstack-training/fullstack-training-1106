4. What is a callback function? Why do we need callbacks?














A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. 
This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);

-----
The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. 
Javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesnâ€™t execute until the other code finishes execution.

function firstFunction() {
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("First function called");
  }, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
  console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output;
// Second function called
// First function called
