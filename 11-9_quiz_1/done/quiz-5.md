follow up: What are the properties used for alignment in Flexbox?



Answer:



The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

follow up: The properties used for alignment in Flexbox are:
    - justify-content: space distribution on the main axis
    - align-content: space distribution on the cross axis
    - place-content: shorthand for setting both of the above properties
    - align-self: aligns a single item on the cross axis
    - align-items: aligns all of the items as a group on the cross axis
