What is a prototype chain? [JS]





Answer:







1. **Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.
2. The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **__proto__** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through **Object.prototype**.
