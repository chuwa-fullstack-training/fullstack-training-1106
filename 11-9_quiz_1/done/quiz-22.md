What is the difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden”, when used as attributes to the HTML element.[HTML, CSS]


Answer:




When we use the attribute “visibility: hidden” for an HTML element then that element will be hidden from the webpage but still takes up space. Whereas, if we use the “display: none” attribute for an HTML element then the element will be hidden, and also it won’t take up any space on the webpage.
