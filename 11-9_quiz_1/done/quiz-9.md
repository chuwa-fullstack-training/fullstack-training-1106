What is Closure? What is Hoisting? [JS]




Answer:






A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing functionâ€™s variables. The closure has three scope chains

function Welcome(name) {
  var name = name;
  
  var greetingInfo = function (message) {
    console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John



Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

console.log(message); 
var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";

|||

var message;
console.log(message);
message = "The variable Has been hoisted";

|||

message("Good morning"); //Good morning
function message(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
