/**
 * write a program that prints a list of files in the given directory, filtered by the extension of the files.
 * The first argument is the directory name and the second argument is the extension filter.
 * Print the list of files (one file per line) to the console.
 *
 * HINTS:
 * 1. Use fs.readdir() method to read the contents of a directory.
 * 2. Use path.extname() method to get the extension of a file. (optional)
 * 3. Use process.argv to get command-line arguments.
 *  - process.argv[0] is the path to the node program
 *  - process.argv[1] is the path to the script file
 *  - process.argv[2] is the first command-line argument
 *    e.g. node hw1.js currentDir txt - process.argv[2] is `currentDir`, process.argv[3] is `txt`
