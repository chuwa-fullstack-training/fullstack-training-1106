/**
 * For sample code web-server.js, make the following changes:
 * Once submitting in home.html, stay on the same page and display the submitted data.
 * 
 * Hint:
 * 1. put the data of the submitted form in the query string of the url
 * 2. before res.end() in POST method, redirect to the home.html page with the query string
 *  - i.e. res.statusCode = 302; res.setHeader('Location', '/home.html?name=John&age=20');
 * 3. you need to figure out how to parse the query string in the home.html page
 * 4. after writing the html content, you need to write the query string in the html as well
