10. What is TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?























TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Conceptually, the relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript is comparable to that of SASS and CSS. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScriptâ€™s ES6 version with some additional features.

TypeScript is an object-oriented and statically typed language, similar to Java and C#, whereas JavaScript is a scripting language closer to Python. The object-oriented nature of TypeScript is complete with features such as classes and interfaces, and its static typing allows for better tooling with type inference at your disposal.
