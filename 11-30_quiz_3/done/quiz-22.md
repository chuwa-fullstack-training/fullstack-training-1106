22. Create a function named throwOn2 which accepts an integer as an argument and returns the integer if it is not 2.  If it is 2, the function should throw an error with message "2 is not allowed."

For example:

throwOn2(3) should return 3
throwOn2(2) should throw an error and error.message should be "2 is not allowed"
