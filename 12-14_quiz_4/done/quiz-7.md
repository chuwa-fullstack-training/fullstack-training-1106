7. What are the different phases of component lifecycle?



















The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.

Updating: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.

Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.
