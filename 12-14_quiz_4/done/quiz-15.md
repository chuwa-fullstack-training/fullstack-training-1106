What are the use cases for server-side rendering and client-side rendering?

















Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where web pages are generated on the server and sent as fully rendered HTML to the client. In SSR, the server processes the request, fetches the data, generates the HTML content, and sends it to the client. The client then receives the pre-rendered HTML and displays it to the user.


Client-Side Rendering (CSR), on the other hand, is a technique where the web page is initially delivered as a bare-bones HTML document, and the rendering process happens on the client-side using JavaScript. The client-side rendering approach downloads the necessary JavaScript code, fetches data from APIs, and then manipulates the DOM to render the content.
